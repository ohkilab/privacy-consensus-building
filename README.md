# An Investigative Study of Consensus-Building Process in Privacy Disclosure Using Benefit Scale

## Abstract
We investigated a consensus-building process for privacy disclosure between users and service providers focusing on the obtained benefits. In recent researches such as Marian (2014) et al., the purpose is to support appropriate privacy information disclosure by improving users' privacy knowledge. On the other hand, we hypothesized that the privacy disclosure is affected not only by the knowledge about privacy information but also the benefit obtained from the service in exchange for it. In this paper, we developed a benefit scale which measures users' perceived intentions for benefits. In addition, we clarified the relationship between the benefit scale and the privacy disclosure behavior assuming the situation in which a user disclosed privacy information.  Furthermore, we clarified the effect of the intelligibility to the service on the relation.
